A creative journey to generate music inspired by Dream Theater using the power of machine learning.

This project draws inspiration from Dream Theater's captivating 2016 concept album, "The Astonishing." Set in a fictional dystopian society, people have lost the ability to create music, and the only semblance of it comes from the NOMACS (Noise Machines). These floating machines (depicted below on the album cover) emit discordant, monotonous, and emotionless sounds. The ultimate goal of NomacNet is to transcend these limitations and craft music that embodies the true spirit of creativity (ðŸ¤ž)!
