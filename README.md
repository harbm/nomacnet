# nomacnet ðŸŽ¶ðŸ¤–


This project draws inspiration from Dream Theater's 2016 astonishing concept album, "The Astonishing." Set in a fictional dystopian society, people have lost the ability to create music, and the only semblance of it comes from the NOMACS (Noise Machines). However, these floating machines (shown below on the album cover) only emit discordant, monotonous, and emotionless sounds. The goal of NomacNet is to transcend these limitations and craft awesome music.

I plan to use NomacNet to refine my composition process and produce/record original pieces combining AI-generated music and my own musical creations. 

More to come soon.
